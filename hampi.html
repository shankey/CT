            <div>
            Hampi is one of the most popular tourist destination in Karnataka, and certainly one of the best for people staying in closeby cities such as Hyderabad and Bangalore. It lies within the ruins of the ancient Vijaynagar empire. It is also a UNESCO recognized World Heritage Site. Hampi would definitely capture the tourists in a special kind of magic owing not only to its historical richness but also the beaty of the entire place. Typical big boulders of the Deccan combined with the sparkling green palm and banana platations across the banks of Tungabhadra would make anyone spellbound. Hampi has many interesting stories to narrate of the royal regins through the remains of beautiful structures and monuments that once embellished the city.

                        Best time to visit Hampi is during winters (November to February). This time is when the it's pleasantly chilly. The days are pleasant at around 30 degrees and nights become chilly at around 10-12 degrees. 
Monsoons in Hampi are beautiful too (June to August). However, summers in Hampi are hot (March-May). The sun is scorching and maximum temperature goes beyond 40 degrees.

 <p>We took a bus from Hyderabad to Hampi. Buses from Hyderabad to Hospet (12 Kms from Hampi) are readily available. After an 8 hour journey, we reached Hospet at 4 in the morning. We had pre-requested the hotel for an early check-in. However, at the reception we were informed there wasn’t a room available till the actual check-in time. Both of us were slightly tired after the bus journey and having to give explanations to the hotel manager was quite a dampener. On top of that, we were given a suite but without AC. But Royal Orchid made up for the slipup by shifting us to an AC suite at 10 AM and giving us free meals for the entire trip! <br>
After a grand breakfast and sumptuous lunch at the Royal Orchid 24X7 Café, we left for our ruins excursion at 2 PM. </p> <br>   

<p>Hampi is split into two parts – south and north of Tungabadhra river strip in between. Barney is much better than me when it comes to planning and rationalising. He suggested that we should cover the south part on day-1 and north on day-2 for we were too late to cover both the same day. South part in itself has quite a lot to explore. We took an auto from outside the hotel to the main Hampi site for cabs unnecessarily charge more than 10X of autos.</p><br>

<p>The whole Hampi site is quite wide & vast and one cannot cover the same on foot, especially under the hot summer sun. We carried the map of all places to visit which the hotel provided and marked the best places we wanted to visit. We hired a guide who claimed to have an authorized license from the state government. And it turned out a good decision after all because the information he gave us while vising each of the sites was not only rich with respect to its history but also very interesting.</p>

            </div>
<p>We first visited Sasivekalu Ganesha with beautiful stone work and then moved to Shiv temple with the famous 3 Mts long Shivlinga. It’s said that the Shivlinga was carved out of one single stone and it always remains immersed in natural water all through the year.</p>
            <div class="clearboth">

                </div>
<p>we then moved King’s palace which had gone underground. The Lotus Mahal and Queen’s Bath were two exquisitely wonderful monuments inside. There are interesting stories about what Queens did in their leisure time. Elephant Stable is another popular and beautiful edifice there.</p>
            <div class="clearboth">

            </div>
<p>Next, we moved to Vijay Vitthal Temple where we saw the huge stone chariot. The temple was in ruins, but detailed and beautifully etched small carvings on stone pillars were striking! Several Bollywood movies scenes and songs have been shot at the temple premises.</p><br><br>

     
<img class="left-align" src="images/Hampi_images/Mango%20Tree.jpg">
<p>Our last historical destination for the day was Virupaksha temple – the most popular and recognized temple among the group of temples. They say people around Hampi, even big cities, believe that marrying at Virupaksha temple is auspicious and is considered to be complete.</p><br>


<p>After we ended the excursion, it was already around 6 PM. We then planned to sit for a bit at one of the most popular eateries at Hampi called “Mango Tree”. The place has a very goan feel to it with mattresses laid out on the floor along with floor tables and crowd mainly consisting of foreigners. The place serves awesome masala papad and ginger tea.</p>

<p>We took at auto back to the hotel, rested for a while before enjoying free dinner at the hotel premises, followed by a walk around the hotel grounds. Day-1 well spent :)</p><br> <br>

<p><b>Day-2</b></p>
                    <img class="right-align" src="images/Hampi_images/Round%20stereotypic%20boats%20at%20Tungabhadra%20river%20crossing.jpg">
<p>We thought of exploring the other side of Tungabhadra River the next day.</p>
                    <p>We left the hotel around 12 PM to the ghat from where boats leave at a regular intervals from one point to another. These boats are shared ones and help the tourists go from the south side to the north side of Hampi through crossing the river. However jazzy though it may sound, the boat ride is only 5 minutes long. If you seek more adventure, you could even take one of those small round raft like boats called Coracle. They are available too at the same ghats from where all the other boats leave.</p><br>

<p>Once we reached the other side, we planned to get an activa on rent to go uphill to the Hanuman temple. Activa ride a lone hillside with lush green fields on one side, giant Deccan rocks on the other, and bright blue skies – what else does anyone need after all? Nothing at all! It was ultimate bliss!</p><br>
        <img class="left-align" src="images/hampi/image15-57.jpg">

<p>You won’t have to look for these guys who give two wheelers on rent. They’ll approach you the moment you step out of the boat. After a bout of negotiation, we rented it for 300 bucks including 1 litre petrol (or so he claimed). Later we stopped at one of the kiosks to get half a litre of petrol filled.</p><br>
                    <p> Before riding up to the temple, we planned to stop by to grab a quick bite. We explored a few cafeterias on the roadside but most of them seemed to the shut due to the odd timing. Untimately, we landed at FunKy Monkey restaurant. It’s not a super popular restaurant the way Mango Tree is; however, the look and feel of the place is very similar. It has jute mattresses placed on the floor along with floor cushions and floor tables. The place is full of colourful danglers and hangings across the walls and open spaces and invites a lot of expats.</p><br>
                    <img class="right-align" src="images/Hampi_images/Stupendous%20view%20of%20Hampi%20from%20Monkey%20Temple%20on%20top%20of%20Anjaneya%20Hill.jpg">

                    <p> After chilling there for an hour or so, we finally started our active ride to the temple. The surroundings are breathtakingly beautiful! We crossed sun kissed green fields with long light green grass. The Deccan by the other side gave a perfect contrasting shade to the picturesque surroundings. Cool breeze touching our faces during the ride on the sunny afternoon was a special add on to the overall experience.</p><br>
    <p>The Monkey Temple has around 700 stairs. We parked the active and started climbing the stairs. The temple lies on top of the Anjaneya Hill, which is claimed to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. It’s a little bit of an effort to climb up due to the elevation. However, the climb is worth the effort! Once you reach the top, a stupendous view of complete Hampi awaits you. The temple is small yet beautiful. It’s peaceful and serene.</p><br>
                    <img class="left-align" src="images/Hampi_images/Fountain%20garden.JPG">
                    <p>We returned the bike and went back to the river crossing area. We took the last boat at 6 PM and went to the other side. We took an auto to Tungabhadra garden which is famous for its musical fountain. It had already started getting a little dark and that’s actually the best time to enjoy the place. The garden is huge divided into various sections. The fountain started playing at around 7. A bunch of school kids had come there for a picnic. Although the fountain not super spectacular, the excitement with which the school kids enjoyed the performance and clapped with every rise and fall of the waters was worth a sight! </p>
                    <p>We went back to the hotel, grabbed quick dinner and left for our bus. The two day journey was sadly coming to an end. Our experience with the hotel and Hampi overall was brilliant and memorable:)</p><br><br>
