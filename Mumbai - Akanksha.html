            <div>
            Metro City – check, Most populated Indian city – check, Financial capital of India – check. Why would you then call Mumbai a holiday destination for couples? Agree. It may not be a perfect holiday destination. But for people who’ve stayed here long enough would understand what the Mumbai feel does to someone. Yes, it’s crowded and in fact dirty, but it has a beautiful vintage charm and a distinctive arty feel, which no other India city has. Yes, might seem oxymoronic, because it really is. Even though the city is crowded with people, there are things there that have a magnetic pull and would make any couple overwhelmed in romance. Amazing places to eat out, Sea link road, the lively Juhu beach, rich culture of theatre and love for Bollywood, historical monuments and of course the Marine Drive. The city has a lot to offer – so couples, do not underestimate aamchi Mumbai! :)

                   Mumbai International Airport, called Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport is one of the largest airports of the country. Regular flights – both international and domestic – ply from the city. The airport is around 30 Kms from the main city towards the north. Since the city has traffic issues, it is always safe to take some buffer time while travelling to or from the airport. Cabs and taxis are easily available from the airport to the city.

                      Mumbai has a very well established and well connected train network with other Indian cities. Infact, most of the connecting trains to other cities in the state go via Mumbai itself.

                       Mumbai is perfectly connected by roads to rest of India. Driving down to Mumbai is never an issue. However, traffic within the city is a little bit on the extreme side. The common cities from where people drive down to Mumbai include Pune (160 Kms), Nashik (200 Kms) and Aurangabad (400 Kms). Mumbai also has small hill stations located around which are popularly visited on weekends or long drives, such has Lonavala, Khandala, Mahabaleshwar, etc.

                       It is best to visit Mumbai during winter months – from November to February. The weather remains pleasant with temperature doing down to a minimum of 9-10 degrees. Mumbai doesn’t get colder than that. Day time remains peasant too. However, summer months are usually bad considering high levels of heat and humidity witnessed by Mumbai from late March to May. June to September are monsoon months. Although Mumbai monsoons are considered to be ultra-romantic, you won’t like them if you’re not rain loving couple. Mumbai rains are very unpredictable and continue for a long time. However, if you love rains, nothing better getting drenched while having a gola at Juhu Chowpaty beach.

 <p>I was always longing to go to Bombay after reading and hearing so much about a Delhite being in Bombay (Grade 9 inter school competition trip doesn’t count). And since he hailed from the city, it was the perfect reason for a visit now.</p><br>
            <p>And so it was planned under the garb of a work trip every time but with the real agenda of spending time together and discovering Bombay (long distance is tough you see, sigh). Of course there was a checklist and we still have it; we try to cross as much as possible with each of my Mumbai trips now (Yes, I do visit often). We have done a lot of things which even he hadn’t done before having lived in the city for so long! So this is an amalgamation of us discovering Bombay and the best of our moments. Read on…</p><br>

            <p>For starters, I love the name Bombay - the name itself has a vintage charm and makes you go back in time (no, don’t imagine those black and white movies). And he would make it a point to call it out and say Mumbai, not for being righteous but for the fear of being overheard by locals (read Shiv Sena). All those noob to the distinction - the city has been named after the patron deity Mumbaidevi, and has always been referred as “Mumbai” by locals with Bombay believed to being the colonial corrupted version of it. In 1995, officially Bombay became Mumbai. Nevertheless, I’m yet to learn to call it Mumbai.</p><br>
             <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="images/Akanksha_Mumbai_Images/Mumbai%20Cover.jpg"></p><br>
            
            <p>Prithvi Theatre was the top one on my list, and so we booked a convenient time after work hours for our first live show together. The show was “Madbeth”, a one hour and one-man effort. And we both wondered how this guy will pull off a show by himself for an hour while sipping the Irish Coffee at the Prithvi Cafe (Don’t miss it, all you coffee lovers). We realized it was too late and theater had begun entry and rushed to join the queue to get good seats. We enjoyed the play thoroughly often times rolling over each other and laughing. It was tragic yet humorous, and the improvisations gave a new angle each time to what was an attempted satire on Macbeth. The protagonist often referred to his pranks in the play as “premiere” in a certain funny tone, and it has since then become our internal joke each time we attempt a prank.</p><br>
                    <img class="center-align-full-row" src="images/Akanksha_Mumbai_Images/Prithvi%20Theatre.jpg"><br><br>    
             <img class="center-align-full-row" src="images/Akanksha_Mumbai_Images/prithvi%20theatre%20irish%20coffe.jpg"><br><br>    
<p>Stand-up is his thing and he would even love to do it on stage and not just watch it. And so we planned to catch up on a stand show. Bombay has a pretty strong comedy scene I gathered. The show was packed, no doubt as he had chosen a day when they had the best performers in the city - Gursimran Khamba (now with AIB, well known comedy group), Neeti Palta, Daniel Fernandez and a few open mics. This was a two-hour show at Canvas Laugh Club, Palladium Mall, Lower Parel. We settled in with our drinks and laughed on. Those were the days when stand-up was new to India (or you can say — to me). He could see I was getting upset one or the other time on some extreme racist or fascist joke and told me to go with the flow rather than being righteous all the time. We were in this wonderful process of discovering each other.</p><br>
            <p><img class="center-align-full-row" src="images/Akanksha_Mumbai_Images/canvas%20laungh%20factory.jpg"></p><br>
            
<p>The other time, I had an early morning flight to catch to work and we just had a few hours to spend time together. Hence we decided to go to Marine Drive. It has the end of a long weekend and it was 12am already but you could still see Marine Drive as lively as it would be at any other time during the day. It was bustling with hawkers - chai walas, coffee walas, candies, ice cream stands and most of all — tons of families, college students, groups of friends and couples. All of these people brought together by their plain and simple love for the cool sea breeze which wouldn’t stop! It was indeed the perfect place for a conversation. And we had long catching up to do from sharing our school to college stories to discussing the latest movie we saw and the Chinese food we just ate. I was a little cautious since moral policing is pervasive in Bombay, so we maintained our distance and took a walk to the other side after every few minutes.</p><br>
             <img class="center-align-full-row" src="images/Akanksha_Mumbai_Images/Marine%20drive.jpg"><br><br>
<p>Time passed quickly and hours seemed like minutes before it was already time for my flight and he dropped me to the airport. With too much caffeine in my system (thanks to the wonderful coffee by the hawkers at Marine drive), I was sure shot to think about him in plane and screw up my day at work.</p><br><br><br>
